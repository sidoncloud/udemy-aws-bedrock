      " AWS Bedrock is a service provided by Amazon Web Services that allows customers to securely store and manage documents in the cloud. As of my last training data in February 2024, the pricing for AWS Bedrock is based on the amount of data stored, the number of transactions performed, and the usage of additional features such as document conversion and data migration.\n",
